# Clutter Specs

## Assumptions & Requirements
 - Reuse some of the original crazy cat stuff for UI, but have an option to turn off the background (tone it down)
 - Our goal is to have a competent, show-worthy app, but it doesn't have to be perfect
 - We'd like to end up with something that people would enjoy playing with and would be good to show off to bluesky folks
 - Use open source widgets / UIs wherever helpful
